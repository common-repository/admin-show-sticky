Adds a new column to the posts table in the admin to display if a post is sticky or not.

== Description ==

Adds a new column to the posts table in the admin to display if a post is sticky or not.

Determining what posts are sticky or not should be easier than editing each post or comparing a list of posts displayed on your site to the list in the Edit Posts table in the admin.  This plugin will add a new column titled `Sticky` and place a check mark in this column if the post is `Sticky`.

Props to [Joel Fisher](http://flushinc.com/) for the idea behind this plugin.
